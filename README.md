Hi, I’m Varshith 👋

I work in DevOps and cloud engineering, mainly focused on building, deploying, and operating reliable systems on cloud platforms.  
This GitHub space is where I share hands-on work related to automation, infrastructure, and application delivery.

### About

Most of what you’ll find here comes from real problems I’ve worked on while supporting production environments.  
The projects are simplified and cleaned up for sharing, but the ideas and patterns behind them reflect practical experience rather than demos or tutorials.

I tend to focus on making systems easier to run, safer to change, and more predictable over time.

---

### What I Work On

My day-to-day work typically includes:

- Designing and maintaining cloud infrastructure  
- Building CI/CD pipelines and release workflows  
- Running containerized applications on Kubernetes  
- Automating infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code  
- Improving visibility with logging, metrics, and alerts  
- Applying security practices as part of delivery, not after  

The examples here don’t try to cover everything — they highlight common patterns and trade-offs.

### Tools & Platforms

I’ve worked with a range of tools depending on the environment, including:

- Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud  
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerized workloads  
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitOps-style workflows  
- Terraform and cloud-native provisioning tools  
- Monitoring and logging systems used in production  

Tools change over time; the fundamentals don’t.

### How to Use This Repository

Each project or example can be viewed independently.  
Feel free to skim, explore details, or focus on what’s most relevant.

The goal is to show how I approach building and operating systems, not just the final configuration.

### A Few Things I Care About

- Keeping systems reliable and easy to operate  
- Reducing manual work through automation  
- Catching issues early through observability  
- Balancing delivery speed with stability  
- Treating security and reliability as shared responsibilities
